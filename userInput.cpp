// cout is used to output or print the values.
// Now we use cin to get the user values (user input).

// syntax : cin >> (variable)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x, y;
    cout << "Enter the value of x ";
    cin >> x;
    cout << "THe value of x is " << x << endl;

    cout << "Enter the value of y ";
    cin >> y;
    cout << "THe value of  is " << y << endl;
    cout << "THe sum of x and y is " << x+y << endl; 
    return 0;
}

// operators in cpp are same as other lnaguages

/* + - addition
 - - subtraction 
 * - multiolication
 / - division
 % - modulus
 ++ - increment
 -- - decrement 

 = - assignment
 += - x = x+2 example
 and same for other operators as well

 comparator, logical operators are also same as other languages
